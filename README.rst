Calls for Telethon
==================

This module aims to provide support for performing voice calls through
`Telethon <https://github.com/LonamiWebs/Telethon>`_. Please note that
currently this module is far from usable, and is more a proof of concept.

**Huge thanks** to `@stek29 <https://github.com/stek29>`_ for his amazing
`gist <https://gist.github.com/stek29/9ced63a52199faf2d0b2fd9e99b49109>`_ on
how to get calls working, and for helping me spot certain bugs that occured
after porting the JavaScript code to Python. *Thank you* from saving me from
another three days of headaches!
